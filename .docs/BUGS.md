## BUG-002: "fatal: ref HEAD is not a symbolic ref" printed for every vacant slot during reconciliation

**Status**: open
**Found**: 2026-02-23T08:00:00Z
**Fixed**:
**Test run**: ~/wt-usage-tests/2026-02-23T08-00-00/

### Description

Every `wt` command that triggers reconciliation (i.e., all commands) calls `git.currentBranch(slotPath)` for each worktree slot directory. `currentBranch` runs `git symbolic-ref --short HEAD` with `stdio: ["ignore", "pipe", "inherit"]`, which means git's stderr is inherited by the process. When a slot is in detached HEAD state (vacant slots always are), this command fails with:

```
fatal: ref HEAD is not a symbolic ref
```

This error is printed once per vacant slot to the user's terminal, regardless of which `wt` command they run. With 5 slots and 4 vacant, the user sees this message 4 times on every `wt list`, `wt checkout`, etc.

**What happened**: Running `wt list` on a fresh container with 5 slots (1 on `main`, 4 vacant) printed "fatal: ref HEAD is not a symbolic ref" 4 times before showing the slot table.

**What should have happened**: No git error output for internal state-checking operations. The "git errors pass through verbatim" rule in VISION.md §15.3 applies to user-initiated git operations (checkout, fetch, stash apply), not internal reconciliation queries.

### Reproduction

```bash
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
wt init file:///path/to/remote.git
wt list
# Output: 4 × "fatal: ref HEAD is not a symbolic ref" before the slot table
```

### Vision reference

VISION.md §15.3: "All git errors are passed through to the user verbatim. `wt` does not wrap, reinterpret, or suppress git error messages. If `git checkout`, `git fetch`, `git stash apply`, or any other git operation fails, the user sees git's native error output."

The key phrase is "if `git checkout`, `git fetch`, `git stash apply`, **or any other git operation** fails" — this refers to user-facing operations, not internal state queries like `git symbolic-ref HEAD` used to determine whether a slot is detached. The fix is to pipe stderr for `currentBranch` (and any other internal-only git calls) rather than inheriting it.

### Fix

In `src/core/git.ts`, change `currentBranch` to use `stdio: ["ignore", "pipe", "pipe"]` (or `stderr: 'pipe'`) so that the expected failure for detached HEAD is silently discarded. The function already returns `null` on failure; the stderr output is noise.

## BUG-001: Untracked files lost during slot eviction (stash create does not include untracked)

**Status**: fixed
**Found**: 2026-02-23T07:05:00Z
**Fixed**: 2026-02-23T07:20:00Z
**Test run**: ~/wt-usage-tests/2026-02-23T10-00-00/

### Description

When a slot is evicted (LRU eviction on checkout), `wt` saves dirty state via `git stash create --include-untracked`. The expectation per the vision is that staged, unstaged, AND untracked files are all saved in the stash. However, `git stash create --include-untracked` in git 2.47.3 (and likely all recent versions) does NOT include untracked files — it only creates a 2-parent stash commit containing tracked changes.

In contrast, `git stash push --include-untracked` creates a proper 3-parent stash commit where the 3rd parent holds untracked files. `git stash apply` correctly restores the 3rd parent's tree when applying such stashes.

**What happened**: A slot with `auth.js` (modified), `staged.js` (staged), and `untracked.txt` (untracked) was evicted. After re-checking out the branch, `auth.js` and `staged.js` were restored, but `untracked.txt` was silently lost.

**What should have happened**: All three categories of dirty state should have been restored after re-checkout.

### Reproduction

```bash
# Init a container from a remote
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
wt init <some-repo-url>

# Fill all slots so eviction is needed
wt checkout branch-a

# Create dirty state with untracked file in branch-a slot
echo "untracked" > untracked.txt

# Checkout a new branch to trigger LRU eviction of branch-a
wt checkout branch-b  # (when slots are full)

# Re-checkout branch-a — untracked.txt should be restored, but it isn't
wt checkout branch-a
ls -la  # untracked.txt is missing
```

### Vision reference

VISION.md — "Dirty state (staged, unstaged, untracked) is stashed via `git stash create -u`, anchored with `refs/wt/stashes/*` refs, metadata in `.wt/stashes/`."

The vision's prescription of `git stash create -u` doesn't work for untracked files. The implementation needs to either:
1. Use `git stash push --include-untracked` then read back the resulting stash hash from `refs/stash`, OR
2. Manually collect untracked files and store them in a separate commit tree anchored with a ref alongside the main stash ref.

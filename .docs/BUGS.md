## BUG-001: Untracked files lost during slot eviction (stash create does not include untracked)

**Status**: open
**Found**: 2026-02-23T07:05:00Z
**Fixed**: —
**Test run**: ~/wt-usage-tests/2026-02-23T10-00-00/

### Description

When a slot is evicted (LRU eviction on checkout), `wt` saves dirty state via `git stash create --include-untracked`. The expectation per the vision is that staged, unstaged, AND untracked files are all saved in the stash. However, `git stash create --include-untracked` in git 2.47.3 (and likely all recent versions) does NOT include untracked files — it only creates a 2-parent stash commit containing tracked changes.

In contrast, `git stash push --include-untracked` creates a proper 3-parent stash commit where the 3rd parent holds untracked files. `git stash apply` correctly restores the 3rd parent's tree when applying such stashes.

**What happened**: A slot with `auth.js` (modified), `staged.js` (staged), and `untracked.txt` (untracked) was evicted. After re-checking out the branch, `auth.js` and `staged.js` were restored, but `untracked.txt` was silently lost.

**What should have happened**: All three categories of dirty state should have been restored after re-checkout.

### Reproduction

```bash
# Init a container from a remote
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
wt init <some-repo-url>

# Fill all slots so eviction is needed
wt checkout branch-a

# Create dirty state with untracked file in branch-a slot
echo "untracked" > untracked.txt

# Checkout a new branch to trigger LRU eviction of branch-a
wt checkout branch-b  # (when slots are full)

# Re-checkout branch-a — untracked.txt should be restored, but it isn't
wt checkout branch-a
ls -la  # untracked.txt is missing
```

### Vision reference

VISION.md — "Dirty state (staged, unstaged, untracked) is stashed via `git stash create -u`, anchored with `refs/wt/stashes/*` refs, metadata in `.wt/stashes/`."

The vision's prescription of `git stash create -u` doesn't work for untracked files. The implementation needs to either:
1. Use `git stash push --include-untracked` then read back the resulting stash hash from `refs/stash`, OR
2. Manually collect untracked files and store them in a separate commit tree anchored with a ref alongside the main stash ref.

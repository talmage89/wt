Tests performed:
- wt init from local file:// URL (bare clone) — succeeded
- wt list from inside container: showed 1 active slot (main) + 4 vacant slots correctly
- Observed: "fatal: ref HEAD is not a symbolic ref" printed 4 times for vacant (detached HEAD) slots during reconciliation
- Bug confirmed: currentBranch() in reconcile uses stdio inherit for stderr, leaking internal git errors to terminal
Result: BUG FOUND
Bug: BUG-002 — "fatal: ref HEAD is not a symbolic ref" printed for every vacant slot on every wt command (see .docs/BUGS.md)

Location: ~/wt-usage-tests/2026-02-23T10-00-00/
Tests performed:
- wt init from local repo URL (bare clone path)
- wt checkout of remote-only branches (feature/auth, feature/api, fix/bug-123, feature/db)
- wt list output format and slot assignment verification
- Stash save on LRU eviction: slot with staged + unstaged + untracked changes evicted
- Stash restore on branch re-checkout: verified staged/unstaged restored, untracked NOT restored
- git stash create --include-untracked confirmed to omit untracked files (2-parent only)
- git stash push --include-untracked confirmed to include untracked files (3-parent)
Result: BUG FOUND
Bug: BUG-001 — untracked files silently lost during slot eviction due to git stash create not supporting --include-untracked (see .docs/BUGS.md)

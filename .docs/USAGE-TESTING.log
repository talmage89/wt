# Usage Testing Log

Previous test runs archived to `.docs/archive/USAGE-TESTING.log`.

## 2026-02-26T04:20:00Z

Location: ~/wt-usage-tests/2026-02-26T04-20-00/
Tests performed:
- `wt init <remote-url>`: init from a local bare repo used as remote — verified slot summary (5 slots, one on main, four vacant) and shell integration hint printed correctly
- `wt list`: verified tabular output shows slot name, branch, status, pinned flag, and last-used timestamp
- `wt -` (resume command): checked out feature/login then feature/signup; ran `wt -` — correctly navigated to most-recently-used slot (onyx-algae-wood / feature/signup), nav file written to correct path
- Shell integration: `wt shell-init bash` outputs valid `wt()` function; nav file written by binary at `/tmp/wt-nav-<ppid>`; checkout prints "wt: Navigating to <dir>"
- Reconciliation: directly ran `git checkout -b local-only-branch` inside gravel-puffin-wynd slot (bypassing wt); subsequent `wt list` silently updated state to show local-only-branch — no errors, no warnings
Result: PASS

## 2026-02-26T05:30:00Z

Location: ~/wt-usage-tests/2026-02-26T05-30-00/
Tests performed:
- Checkout branch with `/` in name (`feature/auth/oauth`): correctly checked out into slot, branch name displayed accurately in `wt list`, slot directory populated correctly — encoding/decoding of `/` works
- Eviction with full dirty state (staged + unstaged + untracked): filled all 5 slots, created dirty state in main slot (MM README.md + ?? new-untracked.txt), triggered eviction by checking out new branch — eviction stashed dirty state, restore on re-checkout returned all changes including untracked file
- Pin all slots then checkout new branch: pinned all 5 slots, ran `wt checkout -b should-fail-all-pinned` — received clear error "All worktree slots are pinned. Unpin a worktree or increase the slot count to continue." with exit 1, no partial state left
- Slot count increase via config: edited `.wt/config.toml` directly (slot_count 5→7), ran `wt list` — two new vacant slots created immediately (tundra-loam-brisk, lupine-rustic-ruby) with `git worktree add` printed to terminal
- `wt checkout -b` pre-validation: tried `wt checkout -b main` (existing branch) → "wt: Branch 'main' already exists." with exit 1, no eviction; tried `wt checkout -b new-branch nonexistent-sha` → git fatal error with exit 128, no eviction
Result: PASS

## 2026-02-26T06:30:00Z

Location: ~/wt-usage-tests/2026-02-26T06-30-00/
Tests performed:
- Stash commands (list/show/drop + error cases): created dirty state (staged + untracked), triggered eviction, verified `wt stash list` shows entry; `wt stash show <branch>` displays full diff including untracked files; `wt stash show <branch-with-no-stash>` returns "No stash found" with exit 1; `wt stash apply <nonexistent-branch>` returns "No stash found" with exit 1; `wt stash drop <branch>` prompts for confirmation, drops stash on `y`; list shows empty after drop
- `wt checkout --no-restore` + manual apply: evicted branch with dirty state (staged README.md + untracked file), then checked it back out with `--no-restore` — dirty state was NOT restored (clean working tree), stash entry was preserved; `wt stash apply <branch>` then successfully restored all changes; note: staged change is restored as unstaged after apply (standard git behavior without --index, per spec)
- Slot count decrease via config (5→3): edited config directly, ran `wt list` — 2 LRU slots (puffin-hoar-silent/main, clam-spur-dune/br-a) were silently evicted, directories removed, 3 slots remain
- Slot count decrease below pinned count: pinned all 3 remaining slots, decreased slot_count to 2 → error "Cannot reduce slot count to 2: 3 worktrees are pinned. Unpin worktrees first or choose a higher count." with exit 1, no eviction
- Fetch cooldown: first checkout records `last_fetch_at` in state.toml; second checkout within 10 min does NOT update timestamp (fetch skipped); explicit `wt fetch` always runs and updates timestamp; setting `fetch_cooldown_minutes = 0` in config causes every checkout to fetch
Result: PASS

## 2026-02-26T07:30:00Z

Location: ~/wt-usage-tests/2026-02-26T07-30-00/
Tests performed:
- `wt init` twice: second `wt init` on already-initialized container returns "Directory is not empty" with exit 1 — clear error, no corruption
- `wt checkout main` when main already checked out: correctly navigates to existing slot (orbit-sharp-light), prints "Checked out main in orbit-sharp-light", nav file written with correct path — no spurious eviction
- `wt checkout remote-only-branch` (branch exists only on remote): checkout succeeded, git DWIM created local tracking branch — but "Created local branch remote-only-branch from origin/remote-only-branch" message was NOT printed (BUG-029)
Result: BUG FOUND
Bug: BUG-029 — "Created local branch" message missing when remote-only branch checkout succeeds via git DWIM

## 2026-02-26T09:00:00Z

Location: ~/wt-usage-tests/2026-02-26T09-00-00/
Tests performed:
- Symlink shared file creation: configured `directories = ["configs"]`, placed `.wt/shared/configs/app.env`, ran `wt sync` — symlinks created correctly in all 5 slots (`configs/app.env -> ../../.wt/shared/configs/app.env`)
- Git-tracked file takes precedence over symlink: created `feature/gamma` branch with `configs/app.env` as a git-tracked file; `wt checkout feature/gamma` removed the pre-existing symlink (via `removeSymlinks` step 9), git placed the tracked file, then `establishSymlinks` detected the file was tracked and skipped creating the symlink (printed "Skipping symlink for configs/app.env: file is tracked by git in branch feature/gamma.") — result: slot has the branch-specific tracked file, not the shared symlink
- Template expansion: configured `[[templates]]` with `source = "build.sh.template"`, `target = "build.sh"`, variables `{{BRANCH_NAME}}` and `{{WORKTREE_DIR}}`; `wt sync` generated `build.sh` correctly in all slots with branch-specific values; vacant slot gets empty `{{BRANCH_NAME}}`
- Reconciliation with deleted slot dir: manually `rm -rf bolt-mild-lucid`; ran `wt list` — reconcile detected missing slot, silently ran `git worktree add` to create a new slot (`newt-flume-larch`), maintaining the configured 5-slot count; no crash, clean output
- Broken symlink cleanup: deleted canonical `.wt/shared/configs/app.env` file; ran `wt sync` — all broken symlinks in all slots were removed correctly
Result: PASS

## 2026-02-26T10:00:00Z

Location: ~/wt-usage-tests/2026-02-26T10-00-00/
Tests performed:
- Stash archival lifecycle: created dirty state on `will-be-deleted`, evicted to create stash, faked `last_used_at` to 8 days ago in stash metadata, deleted remote branch from bare repo, ran `wt fetch` — stash archived correctly ("Archived 1 stash(es): will-be-deleted"), patch file written to `.wt/stashes/archive/will-be-deleted.patch` containing full diff including untracked files; note: zstd not available so patch stored uncompressed (expected "Warning: zstd not found. Archived stash stored uncompressed.")
- Drop archived stash: ran `wt stash list` — showed entry with status "archived"; `wt stash drop will-be-deleted` with confirmation → "Stash dropped for 'will-be-deleted'"; archive patch file deleted from disk; `wt stash list` showed "No saved stashes." — full archived stash lifecycle verified
- Corrupt state.toml: wrote invalid TOML (`%CORRUPTED TOML%\n[[[bad section\nkey =`) to `.wt/state.toml`; ran `wt list` — printed "Warning: .wt/state.toml is corrupted. Regenerating from git state." to stderr, then successfully regenerated all 5 slots from git worktree list with epoch timestamps (20510d ago), clean exit code 0 — graceful recovery confirmed
- Manual `git worktree add` in container: ran `git --git-dir=.wt/repo worktree add ./manual-worktree -b manual-branch` directly (bypassing wt); ran `wt list` — reconcile discovered `manual-worktree` as a new slot and added it to state; but because slot count in config is 5 and there were now 6 slots (5 original + manual), `adjustSlotCount` LRU-evicted one original slot (`arch-short-wynd`, branch-a) since all had epoch timestamps from the prior state corruption recovery; `manual-worktree` (manual-branch) appeared in the list as a managed slot — adoption of external worktrees works, slot count enforcement is immediate
Result: PASS
